# About Hotel Management Website

The Hotel Management System presented in this project aims to address the challenges faced by tourist information centers and smaller hotels in managing hotel availability and reservations. Currently, tourist information centers spend a significant amount of time manually calling hotels to check for availability, while smaller hotels struggle to effectively advertise their vacancies. To overcome these issues, the Aptos Chamber of Commerce, a tourist information center in Santa Cruz County, seeks an automated system that can efficiently handle hotel information, route tourists to available accommodations, and free up valuable time for other community services.

The proposed Hotel Management System offers various features such as room reservation, vacancy checks, and online browsing, catering especially to busy business travelers. By leveraging this system, business people can save time and effort in managing their hotel bookings. The system aims to reduce billing errors, minimize delays in providing bills to customers, and maintain a digital record of customer transactions. It also incorporates tax calculations based on customer expenditure, providing accurate and efficient billing processes. Additionally, the system enables the printing of computerized bills within seconds and facilitates online booking of rooms based on the available options.

The objectives of this project encompass the management of customer details, booking and reservation processes, report generation, and guest profile management. The system is designed to streamline administrative tasks while also enhancing the user experience. By automating these key aspects of hotel management, the project aims to reduce manual workloads, improve efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction.

Overall, the Hotel Management System project offers a comprehensive solution to the challenges faced by tourist information centers and smaller hotels. It leverages online technologies to streamline processes, improve accuracy, and save time, benefiting both the service providers and the customers.
